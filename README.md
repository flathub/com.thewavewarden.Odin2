Flatpak notes:

The plugin requires JUCE to build and to run Projucer. For some
unknown reasons Projucer fail within flatpak build, but not when run
in the build sandbox. So we ship the Makefile (that contain some
changes too) and the JuceLibraryCode.

`Source/GitCommitId.h` is generated by us (Projucer would)

- JUCE is the lv2 port recommended by upstream, to build LV2 support.
- `lv2.patch` patches the build system.
- `juce-path.patch` patches JUCE to not use `/opt` but FLATPAK_DEST
string literal. This is required for to locate the presets

Known bugs
----------

Preset won't be saved because of
https://github.com/TheWaveWarden/odin2/issues/322

That assumes a world writable `/opt/odin2` (now FLATPAK_DEST/odin2).
